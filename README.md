In the current version of Ottergram, the detail image is changed when a thumbnail is clicked.  Users who prefer the keyboard can select thumbnails and trigger clicks using the Tab and Enter keys, but the interaction is awkward.

Use JavaScript to add the ability to select a thumbnail and change the detail image by pressing a digit key (e.g., '1' to select Barry, and '5' to select Barbara in the default layout).
